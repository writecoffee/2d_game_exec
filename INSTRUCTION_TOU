-- Command a tank to shoot a target enemy

    Right click on the target unit, out tank will find a ideal path it thinks 
    and embush the enemy. If it stops, that might be caused by the fact that
    the enemy move so fast and it got lost on its way to attack. Once the
    target is locked, the tank would try its best to tail after the target
    and player can let it go and take care of another tank.

    It is possible to dodge a bullet. The AI tank uses the same logic for 
    tracking its prey. So once the player notices that your precious tank
    unit got spotted, try to command the tank and let it move as fast as
    possible to confuscate the enemy.
