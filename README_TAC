      **  Path finding
          The unit use A* algorithm to search for possible path; the path is shown
          in transparent pink color.
      **  View port
          In the game board screen, using mousewheel scrolling for zoom in/out and 
          use <CTRL> + Left-Mouse-Click dragging for panning.
      **  Sprite-sheet images
          When a tank is commanded to go for a grid tile, when it is on the way to
          the destination, the wheel is moving. Also when it is shooting.
      **  Shared images and Animation
          There is a sprite sheet table, sheet name as key and sprite sheet information
          as value. Everytime the same sheet is going to be loaded, it would refer
          to the table first. Every unit maintains its single sprite reference, the
          reference information includes the current frame and its sprite grid location
          on the sprite image.
      **  Behavior Trees
          The tank AI behavior tree is like this
           
              SELECTOR
              |       |
              |       \
              |        -------------------------------
              |                                       \
              |                                       |
            COND                          RANDOM_SEQUENCE_SELECTOR
    (is in line with enemy)      ------------------------------------------
              |                 /              |              |            \
              |                 |              |              |            |
              |               COND            COND          COND          COND
            SHOOT         (North Goable) (South Goable) (East Goable) (West Goable)
                                |              |              |            |
                                |              |              |            |

      **  Unit's moving
          The unit can move to any passable grid using A* algorithm. No overlapping
          between units.
      **  Map file format
          The map file format sticks with the TA example map format.
      **  Tank sprite information
          The tank sprite image information should be provided in directory support/.
          For player tanks, the name of it should be "tank-computer.spr"; for AI
          tanks, the name should be "tank-computer.spr".
          The tank sprite format should be like

          <SPRITE FILE NAME>
          <GRID WIDTH> <GRID WIDTH PADDING>
          <GRID HEIGHT> <GRID HEIGHT PADDING>
          DIR_NORTH
