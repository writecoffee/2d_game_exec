-- Engine Requirements
      **  Collision Detection
          The engine support circle-circle, circle-AAB, AAB-AAB, circle-polygon, AAB-polygon, and
          polygon-polygon collision detection. They are defined under package "engine.collision".
      **  Compound Shapes
          The engine supports compound shapes construction. There is an 1-to-1 relationship
          between Entity and Shape. An entity could be composed of any atomic shapes defined
          in the "entity.collision" package.
      **  World Objects
          The relationship and the message flow (for Tou game) is like the follows:
          ================================================================================
          Engine -> Screen -> ViewPort -> World (1)->(*) Entity
                       |                    |
                       +--------------------+  
          ================================================================================
      **  Free Movements
          The airplane is controled by user's keyboard A-W-S-D. Entity's location is 
          determined by vector (x, y)
      **  Velocity
          It is determined by a constant MOVING_OFFSET for each movable entities. The
          velocity is determined by the equation MOVING_OFFSET / THRESHOLD_TIME_DELTA.
      
-- Game Requirements
      **  Bullet System
          Yield by specific tank unit or player/boss warplane.
      **  AI won
          Once my plane crashed.
      **  Player won
          Once the boss got killed.
      **  Object Collision
          The airplane is a compound shape, which consists of 2 circles, 3 AABs and 2 polygon
          (the warplane's body and wings area). It is highlight in transparent color. The bullet
          fired by the airplane controled by user is treated as AAB object.
      **  Freely-movable unit
          The blue warplant is controled by player. It starts from the upper left corner.
          The plane fires 2 bullets at a time.
      **  Finite Game Board
          The unit cannot move out of the map. When the little airplane and bullet run off the
          boundary of the map, they disappear.
      **  Others
          The bullet fired by player's plane could damage an enemy. The collision is
          obvious, once our airplane hit any enemies, we lost the game. Once the enemies
          being shooted, it disappeared.
